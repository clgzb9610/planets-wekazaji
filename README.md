# Deep Space Diver

Deep Space Diver is a platformer game where you jump between planets through overlapping gravity fields. Collect gears to fix the broken teleporter and move on to the next level! Avoid colliding with enemies: you will lose all of the gears you have collected and need to restart the level. Find a way out and spend a nice vacation on an alien planet!

## Play our Game

## Getting involved

Do you want to be a part of this project? Well, here’s how you can start!

### What we used

We used Javascript for our game. You can use any Javascript editor that you like. But you have to have a local server running to test play the game. Webstorm gave us a solution.

### Download Webstorm

We used [Webstorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/download) for our project that it supports built-in local server. Also, if you’re student, you can download the full version with your student account.

We use [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) for dependency management, so you'll need to install that as well.

### Clone with Webstorm

Click ‘VCS’ >> ‘Check out from Version Control’ >> Git in Webstorm start menu. Log in to your github account. Copy our github repository URL and paste it to ‘Git Repository URL’ textbox.

After you clone it, WebStorm should pop up a message in the bottom right asking if you want to install dependencies using yarn - say yes if it does. If it doesn't ask, just open the `package.json` file and it will pop up the message.

### Running the game on Webstorm

Webstorm has its own local server. Open index.html in Webstorm and on the upper-right side, click on the brower icon you want to run.
